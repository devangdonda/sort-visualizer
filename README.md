# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Python-based tool designed to demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual insight into how algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc., operate under the hood. This project is particularly valuable for those seeking to understand the practical implementation of data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive visualizations of multiple sorting algorithms.
- Real-time algorithm execution.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devangdonda/sort-visualizer.git
    cd sort-visualizer
    ```

2. **Install Pygame**

    Pygame is required to run the visualizer. Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

### Running the Application
Run the application using Python:

```bash
python sorting-visualizer.py
```

Replace `sorting-visualizer.py` with the actual script name, if different.

## Usage
After running the script, you'll see a graphical interface representing the sorting process. Select an algorithm from the provided options to visualize its sorting process in real-time.
